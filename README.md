# graphql-react-app
A repo to practice building an app in React with GraphQL

I spent time learning about GraphQL and wanted to build an app that utilised a GraphQL API, to render data to the browser. 
Following tutorials, I built a backend in Node (localhost:5000) and initially hardcoded dummy data into the schema.js file. 
Root queries were set up to establish the relationship between users and posts, and vice versa. 
A front end was created in React (localhost:3000) and connected to the server using Cors. 
Through various components, data was then correctly rendered to the browser, albeit using dummy data. 

Run two terminals...one for Node backend, and one for React frontend.
Nodemon app in backend and yarn start in front end.
